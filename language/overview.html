            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Near the end of my undergraduate studies, I was contemplating whether or not to enroll into graduate school and get my Masters. When I was learning more towards doing it, I considered what my thesis topic would be.
                The choice I was learning the most towards was designing my own programming language. While I didn't have any idea what it would do, how it would be written, or what the overall goal was, I still thought that
                that would be the most interesting topic for me. I eventually decided to enter the job market rather than get Masters at that time (Currently, I'm in the middle of getting my Masters in Computer Science). </p>

            <p>
                Recently, I been reading articles and listening to videos regarding programming in general. Doing this has sparked my interest in making my own programming language again. Although it isn't required for my Masters
                degree (the Masters program that I'm doing doesn't require a thesis at all), I still feel motivated to attempt this. First, I want to break down the goals and rules of the language. This will be done by listening
                the things I like and dislike about other programming langauges.
